    content: |-
      As a dedicated .NET developer with a passion for desktop applications, I've spent years crafting software solutions that make life simpler and more convenient.
      I have been working for several years with enterprise desktop applications, where I've had the privilege of watching my code directly impact people's daily workflows.

      Currently, I'm expanding my technical horizons through homelabbing, where I have learned a great deal about networking, server management, and container technologies.
      This website is being hosted from my homelab now!
      When I'm not working on production code or optimizing server configurations, you can find me exploring game development or experimenting with various Linux distributions and container orchestration tools.

          I am currently working as a software developer at KSB GIW Inc. to develop, support, and maintain internal tooling to assist engineers in the design and sale of slurry pumps.

          Projects include:
          - #### SLYSEL
            Perform fluid mechanics calculations to predict slurry pump performance
          - #### TestBay
            Replaced a legacy Fortran CLI tool with a modern desktop interface.
            This program monitored live slurry pump testing and provided statistics and charts on performance for operators and customer witnesses.
          - #### R&D HPC
            Worked with researchers and engineers to push the bleeding edge of understanding of slurry fluid dynamics.
            Assisted in the operation of High Performance Clusters, providing orchestration scripts to spawn and monitor simulation tasks, then process the generated data.
          - #### And many others
